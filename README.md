calculates	the	variance	of	values	in	the	range	A1	to	A5	and	stores	the	result	in	B6.

8) Find	standard	deviation --> When	the	user	types	“STDEV A1	A5 B7”	
program calculates	the	standard	deviation	of	values	in	the	range	A1	to	A5	
and	stores	the	result	in	B7.

9) Print data --> When	the	user	types	“PRINT	A1	B7”	program	prints the	
data	values	in	the	range	A1	to	B7.
